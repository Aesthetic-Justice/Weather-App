## Description

The purpose of this simple application is to demonstrate the ease-of-use of the OpenWeather API. This program allows the user to make fetch requests to the API, retrieve the appropriate data, parse through it, and display the most relevant data onto the screen. Users are able to look up the Average temperature, wind, and humidity of the next 5 day window. Additionally, this application demonstrates the usefulness of LocalStorage built into modern browsers. 

## Usage

Attached to this Github and [linked here](https://aesthetic-justice.github.io/Weather-App/) are portals to the application. Please enter the city you wish to grab relevant information about into the search bar on the left and then press search.

Additionally, the user may click any of the previously searched terms listed below the search button to redisplay that city's weather data.
